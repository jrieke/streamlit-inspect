Imagine you installed a package to create balloons:

```python
from somepackage import create_balloon

b = create_balloon()
```

You can quickly figure out that `b` is of type `Balloon`. 
But what can you do with it? This is where [streamlit-inspect](https://github.com/jrieke/streamlit-inspect) 
comes in!

Just write:

```python
from streamlit_inspect import inspect

inspect(b)
```
    
and you get an interactive preview of the object:

"""
b = Balloon("red")
inspect(b)


"""

Another example:
"""
with st.echo():
    inspect(["foo", "bar"])
