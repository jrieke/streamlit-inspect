Imagine you're writing a Streamlit app and using a package to create balloons:

```python
from somepackage import create_balloon

b = create_balloon()
```

But what is `b`? That's where [streamlit-inspector](https://github.com/jrieke/streamlit-inspector) 
comes in:

```python
from streamlit_inspector import inspect

inspect(b)
```
    
This gives you an interactive description of `b`, including its type, attributes, 
and methods:

"""
b = Balloon("red")
inspect(b)


"""

Another example:
"""
with st.echo():
    inspect(["foo", "bar"])
